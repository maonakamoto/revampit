# Product Listing Integration Verification

**Created**: 2025-12-17  
**Last Modified**: 2025-12-17  
**Last Modified Summary: Verification of database, API, and form integration

## Overview

This document verifies that the ProductListingForm component properly integrates with:
1. Database schema
2. Backend API endpoints
3. Data flow from form → API → database

## Database Schema

### Tables Used

1. **`inventory_items`** (from `004_ai_inventory_system.sql`)
   - Stores physical inventory items
   - Fields used:
     - `kivitendo_article_number` (auto-generated: `SELLER-{userId}-{timestamp}`)
     - `selling_price_chf` (from form price, converted from cents)
     - `quantity_available` (set to 1)
     - `condition_override` (from form)
     - `assigned_to` (user ID)
     - `location` (from form)
     - `ai_product_id` (linked after AI product creation)

2. **`ai_extracted_products`** (from `004_ai_inventory_system.sql`)
   - Stores AI-extracted product data
   - Fields used:
     - `original_image_url` (first image URL)
     - `product_name` (from form title)
     - `category` (from form)
     - `condition` (from form)
     - `estimated_price_chf` (from form price, converted from cents)
     - `created_by` (user ID)

3. **`product_images`** (from `004_ai_inventory_system.sql`)
   - Stores product images
   - Fields used:
     - `product_id` (AI product ID)
     - `filename` (auto-generated)
     - `file_path` (image URL)
     - `is_primary` (first image is primary)
     - `uploaded_by` (user ID)

4. **`sustainability_scores`** (optional, if `useAiAnalysis` is true)
   - Stores sustainability scores
   - Currently uses placeholder values

5. **`ai_processing_logs`** (optional, if `useAiAnalysis` is true)
   - Logs AI processing events

### Missing Table

**`marketplace_listings`** table exists but is NOT used by the current API.
- The API creates `inventory_items` and `ai_extracted_products` instead
- Consider using `marketplace_listings` for better separation of concerns

## API Endpoints

### 1. `/api/uploads` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Upload product images
- **Input**: `FormData` with `files` field (multiple files)
- **Output**: `{ ok: true, urls: string[] }`
- **Storage**: Files saved to `public/uploads/{userId}/{filename}`
- **Validation**: 
  - Max 5 files
  - Only images
  - Max 10MB per file

### 2. `/api/seller/products` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Create seller product listing
- **Authentication**: Required (user must have `seller` role)
- **Input**:
  ```typescript
  {
    images: string[],        // Array of image URLs
    title: string,           // Product title
    description: string,      // Product description
    condition: string,       // Product condition
    category: string,        // Product category
    price: number,           // Price in CENTS (not CHF)
    location: string,        // Location
    useAiAnalysis?: boolean // Optional AI analysis
  }
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```typescript
  {
    success: true,
    message: string,
    inventoryId: string,
    aiProductId: string
  }
  ```
- **Database Operations**:
  1. Creates `inventory_items` record
  2. Creates `ai_extracted_products` record
  3. Links inventory to AI product
  4. Creates `product_images` records
  5. Optionally creates sustainability scores and AI logs
  6. Attempts to publish to MedusaJS (non-blocking)

## Form Integration

### Current Issues Fixed

1. **Price Conversion**
   - ✅ Form sends price as string (e.g., "599.00")
   - ✅ API expects price in cents (number)
   - ✅ Fixed: Convert `parseFloat(price) * 100` before sending

2. **Image Upload Response**
   - ✅ API returns `{ ok: true, urls: [...] }`
   - ✅ Form now correctly reads `uploadData.urls`

3. **API Request Format**
   - ✅ Form now sends `images` (not `imageUrls`)
   - ✅ Form sends `price` in cents (not as string)
   - ✅ Removed `brand` and `publish` fields (not used by API)

4. **API Response Handling**
   - ✅ API returns `{ success, message, inventoryId, aiProductId }`
   - ✅ Form now correctly handles this response format

### Data Flow

```
User fills form
  ↓
Form validates (client-side)
  ↓
Images uploaded to /api/uploads
  ↓
Returns image URLs
  ↓
Form sends product data to /api/seller/products
  ↓
API validates user is seller
  ↓
API creates inventory_items record
  ↓
API creates ai_extracted_products record
  ↓
API links inventory to AI product
  ↓
API creates product_images records
  ↓
API attempts MedusaJS publish (non-blocking)
  ↓
Returns success with IDs
  ↓
Form shows success modal
```

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Database Schema
- [x] `inventory_items` table exists and has required fields
- [x] `ai_extracted_products` table exists and has required fields
- [x] `product_images` table exists and has required fields
- [x] Foreign key relationships are correct
- [x] Indexes are in place for performance

### ✅ API Endpoints
- [x] `/api/uploads` endpoint exists and works
- [x] `/api/seller/products` endpoint exists and works
- [x] Authentication is required
- [x] Seller role check is implemented
- [x] Error handling is in place

### ✅ Form Integration
- [x] Form sends correct data format
- [x] Price is converted to cents
- [x] Image URLs are correctly extracted
- [x] Error handling is in place
- [x] Success handling is in place

### ⏳ Remaining Issues

1. **Brand Field**
   - Form has `brand` field but API doesn't use it
   - Consider adding to `ai_extracted_products.brand` field

2. **Marketplace Listings**
   - `marketplace_listings` table exists but isn't used
   - Consider creating marketplace listing after inventory creation

3. **Contact Info**
   - Form has `contactInfo` field but API doesn't use it
   - Consider storing in seller profile or product metadata

4. **MedusaJS Integration**
   - Currently non-blocking (errors are logged but don't fail)
   - Consider making it optional or showing status to user

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test price conversion (CHF to cents)
   - Test image upload response parsing
   - Test API request format

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test full flow: form → upload → API → database
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test seller role validation

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Test complete user journey
   - Test with real images
   - Test with various product data
