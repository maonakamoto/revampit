# Admin UX audit — first principles (Musk lens)

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Scope:** `/admin/timecards`, `/admin/team`, `/admin/tasks`, `/admin/protocols`
**Method:** 4 parallel expert subagents, each examining one section through the lens of "make requirements less dumb → delete the process step → simplify → reduce cycle time."

## Common pattern across all four sections

1. **God components.** TimecardsClient 635 lines (post recent extraction), ProtocolDetailClient 357 lines, DecisionActions 361 lines, sidebar 700+ LOC. Each one mixes 5–15 concerns in a single file.
2. **Buried action surfaces.** "What needs me now" is always behind a filter or tab. Tasks land on "all 50" not "the 3 urgent ones." Recurring schedule is in detail page, not the list.
3. **Redundant state.** Tasks have `currentStatus` AND `isCompleted` — two signals for the same thing. Timecards: month + week views when the payroll cycle is only month.
4. **Theater steps.** 5-step protocol stepper that's never needed (linear flow). Multi-step protocol intake when one paste-box suffices. Tasks-creation form with 11 fields, most empty.
5. **Modal-per-action friction.** Mark a task done = expand a form, fill duration + notes, confirm. 3 separate inline forms in TaskActionsClient.
6. **Tabs hide good work.** Leave-periods card is the best-designed thing on /admin/team, buried in a tab.

## Verdicts per section

| Section | Verdict | Top 3 cuts |
|---|---|---|
| **Timecards** | Forces choice at every keystroke; month/week toggle is junk; AI-assist distracts | (1) Delete month/week toggle (2) Rename save buttons clearly (3) Inline day-edit, drop aside panel |
| **Team** | Conflates 3 workflows (roster + HR ops + culture); ~40% deletable; leave card is orphaned | (1) Move leave to main profile (2) Compress profile form (3) Separate team-culture from HR ops |
| **Tasks** | Scattered without hierarchy; recurring schedule hidden; broadcast vs targeted indistinguishable | (1) Default filter to needs_attention+requested (2) Add schedule column to list (3) Delete duplicate isCompleted badge |
| **Protocols** | Feature bloat defeats core value; voting/proposal pipeline = 4 API roundtrips for 1 decision | (1) Delete workflow stepper (2) Demote attendee mapping from blocking → advisory (3) Eventually: kill voting UI, collapse to single finalize |

## Highest-leverage quick wins (applying this session)

All pure deletions / SSOT additions, all bounded:

| # | Change | Effort | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| Y.1 | Timecards: delete month/week toggle (week never matches payroll cycle) | quick-win | `TimecardsClient.tsx` |
| Y.2 | Timecards: rename "Save" → "Speichern (Entwurf)" and "Einreichen" → "Zur Prüfung einreichen" | quick-win | `TimecardsClient.tsx` |
| Y.3 | Tasks: delete duplicate `isCompleted` badge in detail page (status is the SSOT) | quick-win | `admin/tasks/[id]/page.tsx` |
| Y.4 | Tasks: default landing filter to "needs_attention OR requested" — persist via localStorage | quick-win | `TaskFiltersClient.tsx` |
| Y.5 | Tasks: surface `schedule_human` in the task list table | quick-win | `admin/tasks/page.tsx` |
| Y.6 | Protocols: delete ProtocolWorkflowStepper (55 lines of theater) | quick-win | `ProtocolWorkflowStepper.tsx` |
| Y.7 | Protocols: demote attendee-mapping warning from blocking card → inline advisory | quick-win | `ProtocolDetailClient.tsx` |
| Y.8 | Team: move leave periods card from tab to main profile view | quick-win | `TeamProfileTabs.tsx`, profile page |

## Deferred (require dedicated branch + team input)

These are real wins but each is medium-to-large with risk of breaking a workflow that's actually in use. Need to validate with the actual users before swinging.

| Item | Effort | Why defer |
|---|---|---|
| Timecards inline day-edit (delete aside panel) | medium | Layout rewrite; risk of breaking mobile flow |
| Tasks form: 11 fields → 5 | medium | Need to know which fields admin actually uses |
| Protocols input wizard → single form | medium | Need to verify staff actually have raw content ready (vs benefit from guided flow) |
| Protocols decision voting → "approve + create tasks" 2-button | large | 4 API routes to consolidate; deep workflow change |
| ProtocolDetailClient split by state | large | 357-line refactor; should follow a test-first approach |
| Team form compression (compensation/talent/availability sections) | medium | HR adoption signal needed before cutting fields |

## Things that are actually well-done (don't regress)

- **Status sorting hierarchy** on tasks (needs_attention → requested → in_progress → idle) — first-principles correct
- **Task completion history** with who/when/duration/notes — auditable
- **Timecards status workflow** (draft → submitted → approved/rejected) — clean
- **Team list** scannable initialed avatars
- **Protocol review checklist** (`getProtocolReviewChecklist`) — compact signal
- **Permission-based field gating** on team profile — super-admin fields properly gated

## Execution log (Phase Y — commit `93db2e89`)

| # | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Y.1 | Timecards: deleted month/week toggle UI; mode dormant at 'month' | ✓ |
| Y.2 | Timecards: submit button → "Zur Prüfung einreichen"; save already clear | ✓ |
| Y.3 | Tasks detail: removed duplicate `is_completed` badge (status = SSOT) | ✓ |
| Y.5 | Tasks list: replaced "Typ" column with "Zeitplan" (surfaces `schedule_human`) | ✓ |
| Y.6 | Protocols: deleted `ProtocolWorkflowStepper` (dead code, grep-verified) | ✓ |
| Y.7 | Protocols: attendee-mapping warning → neutral advisory | ✓ |
| Y.4 | Tasks: localStorage default filter | **done** (Phase AB — `action_needed` preset = needs_attention ∪ requested; persisted in localStorage) |
| Y.8 | Team: leave card to main profile | **done** (Z.3 + Phase AA persistent profile header) |
| — | Audit hotfix: extended `AuditEventType` union (Phase W.5 helpers) | ✓ (unblocked DB deploy) |

### What's deferred to a dedicated branch

Per the audit reports, the highest-leverage further changes are non-trivial and warrant their own focused session:

| Item | Effort | Why dedicated |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Timecards: drop aside panel, inline day-edit grid~~ | ~~medium~~ | **Done** — `01b59d93` (`TimecardDayEditor` inline below month grid) |
| Tasks: collapse new-task form 11 → 5 fields | medium | Need to confirm which fields admin actually uses |
| Tasks: delete standalone analytics page | medium | Decide if anyone uses it |
| Protocols: kill DecisionActions voting flow → "approve + create tasks" 2-button | large | 4 API routes to consolidate |
| Protocols: split ProtocolDetailClient (357 lines) by lifecycle state | large | Refactor; test-first approach |
| Team: profile form compression (drop schema-first compensation fields) | medium | HR adoption signal needed |
| Team: separate "team roster" from "team culture" | large | New route + IA decision |

## Execution log (Phase Z — second batch of Musk cuts)

| # | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Z.1 | Tasks: SQL subqueries for `open_request_count` + `has_open_broadcast`; 📢/👤 emoji badges next to title | ✓ |
| Z.2 | Protocols: deleted `ExternalAIPanel` (`handleImportExternal` was the only caller — same `/process-notes` endpoint is reachable from in-app flow) | ✓ |
| Z.3 | Team: hoisted `TeamLeavePeriodsCard` above the tab strip — HR sees who's away regardless of active tab | ✓ |
| Z.4 | Tasks: top stat cards are now Links (`Gesamt`, `Braucht Aufmerksamkeit`, `Angefragt`) — 1-click filter; `AdminStatsGrid` got optional `href` prop | ✓ |
| Z.5 | Protocols: collapsed wizard gate (`{setupComplete && ...}`) — Inhalt section always visible; `canSubmit` still validates. Deleted 4 orphan step components (`MeetingTypeStep`, `ProtocolDetailsStep`, `InputMethodStep`, `ContentInputStep`) — only re-exported by `index.ts`, no actual consumers | ✓ |

## Execution log (Phase AA — admin contrast & interactive SSOT)

**Date:** 2026-06-15  
**Scope:** Malformed Tailwind opacity utilities, low-contrast active/hover states across admin nav, HR, protocols, tasks, dashboard queue.

| # | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| AA.1 | Added `adminInteractive` tokens to `src/lib/admin-ui.ts` (row hover/selected, nav active, avatars, command palette) | ✓ |
| AA.2 | Extended `adminTable.tr` with admin-surface dark hover (replaces broken `/[0.06]/50` strings) | ✓ |
| AA.3 | Team profile: persistent header uses i18n + phone meta; inactive avatar contrast via `adminInteractive.avatarInactive` | ✓ |
| AA.4 | Fixed missed table/list hovers: protocols list, tasks table, dashboard `UnifiedQueue`, command palette | ✓ |
| AA.5 | Public nav: `Projekte` direct link (no dropdown) — matches `navigation.tsx` SSOT comment | ✓ (prior session) |
| AA.6 | Batch-migrated ~70 admin files: all table/list/icon hovers now use `adminInteractive.*` or `adminTable.tr`; zero raw `hover:bg-surface-raised` left under `src/app/admin` and `src/components/admin` | ✓ |

**Last modified:** 2026-06-15 — Phase AB tasks default filter (Y.4).

---

## Execution log (Phase AB — tasks default filter, Y.4)

**Date:** 2026-06-15  
**Scope:** `/admin/tasks` landing experience — show actionable work first, not all tasks.

| # | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| AB.1 | Added `TASK_LIST_FILTERS` + `TASK_LIST_DEFAULT_FILTER` preset in `src/config/tasks.ts` | ✓ |
| AB.2 | `getTasks()` applies `action_needed` as `needs_attention ∪ requested` when URL has no status | ✓ |
| AB.3 | `TaskFiltersClient` seeds/syncs `localStorage` (`admin.tasks.statusFilter`) and normalizes bare URL | ✓ |
| AB.4 | Gesamt stat card links to `?status=all` for explicit full list | ✓ |

**Last modified:** 2026-06-15 — Phase AC documents prior timecards inline editor; smoke-tested push.

---

## Execution log (Phase AC — timecards inline editor, audit closure)

**Date:** 2026-06-15  
**Scope:** Close deferred audit item — inline day editing (no aside panel).

| # | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| AC.1 | Verified `TimecardDayEditor` inline below `TimecardMonthGrid` (landed in `01b59d93`) | ✓ (already in main) |
| AC.2 | Updated stale `/dashboard/timecards` doc comment (removed month/week toggle reference) | ✓ |
| AC.3 | Smoke: `/` 200, `/admin/tasks` + `/admin/erfassung` → login redirect, typecheck + Y.4 tests pass | ✓ |
